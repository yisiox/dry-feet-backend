# Dry Feet Backend

This is the backend for the [Dri-Feet project](https://github.com/ryanozx/dry-feet) written using Flask.
The name is intentionally different to distinguish the repositories. It is also a pun referencing Dri-FIT.

## Quick Start

First, ensure that you have installed Flask, Flask-Cors, and PyYAML.

```
pip install flask
pip install flask-cors
pip install pyyaml
```

To start the development server:

```bash
flask --app dry_feet_api run
```
